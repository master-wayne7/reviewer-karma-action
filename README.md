## Quick Start

### 1. Add the Action to Your Repository

Create `.github/workflows/reviewer-karma.yml`:

#### **Option A: Using from GitHub Marketplace (Recommended)**
```yaml
name: Reviewer Karma Tracker

on:
  pull_request_review:
    types: [submitted, edited, dismissed]
  issue_comment:
    types: [created, edited, deleted]
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize, reopened, closed]
  workflow_dispatch: # Allow manual triggering

jobs:
  update-leaderboard:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    steps:
    - name: Checkout repository
      uses: actions/checkout@v4
      with:
        token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}

    - name: Run Reviewer Karma Action
      uses: master-wayne7/reviewer-karma-action@v1
      with:
        github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        review-point: '1'
        positive-emoji-point: '2'
        constructive-comment-point: '1'

    - name: Commit and push changes
      run: |
        git config --local user.email "action@github.com"
        git config --local user.name "GitHub Action"
        git add REVIEWERS.md
        git diff --quiet && git diff --staged --quiet || git commit -m "Update reviewer karma leaderboard"
        git push
```

#### **Option B: Using from Local Repository (Development)**
```yaml
    - name: Run Reviewer Karma Action
      uses: ./
      with:
        github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        review-point: '1'
        positive-emoji-point: '2'
        constructive-comment-point: '1'
```

### 2. Configure Repository Permissions

Ensure your workflow has the necessary permissions to:
- Read repository contents
- Write to the repository (for updating `REVIEWERS.md`)

### 3. The Action Will Generate

A `REVIEWERS.md` file in your repository root with content like:

```markdown
# Reviewer Karma Leaderboard

This leaderboard tracks reviewer engagement and contributions to the repository.

## Scoring System

- ‚úÖ Giving a code review: +1 point
- ‚úÖ Review includes a positive emoji (üëç, üî•, üòÑ, etc.): +2 points
- ‚úÖ Review comment contains a constructive message (>10 words): +1 point

## Current Rankings

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

You can customize the scoring system using these environment variables:

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `REVIEW_POINT` | `1` | Points for submitting a review |
| `POSITIVE_EMOJI_POINT` | `2` | Points for including positive emojis |
| `CONSTRUCTIVE_COMMENT_POINT` | `1` | Points for constructive comments |
| `INCREMENTAL_UPDATE` | `false` | Use incremental updates (only process new PRs) |

### Action Inputs

When using the action, you can also configure via inputs:

```yaml
- name: Run Reviewer Karma Action
  uses: ./
  with:
    github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    review-point: '2'           # Custom review points
    positive-emoji-point: '3'   # Custom emoji points
    constructive-comment-point: '2' # Custom comment points
    incremental-update: 'true'  # Enable incremental updates
```

## Positive Emojis

The action recognizes these positive emojis for bonus points:
- üëç üî• üòÑ üéâ üöÄ üíØ ‚úÖ ‚≠ê ‚ù§Ô∏è üëè

## Bot Detection

The action automatically filters out comments and reviews from:
- Users with `[bot]` suffix
- Common bot usernames (`github-actions[bot]`, `dependabot[bot]`, etc.)
- Users with `-bot` or `bot-` in their username

## Constructive Comment Detection

A comment is considered "constructive" if it:
- Contains more than 10 words after filtering
- Excludes common non-constructive phrases like "LGTM", "looks good", etc.
- Provides meaningful feedback or discussion

## Development

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.24+
- Docker (for building the action)

### Building Locally

```bash
# Install dependencies
go mod download

# Build the application
go build -o reviewer-karma .

# Run locally (requires GITHUB_TOKEN environment variable)
export GITHUB_TOKEN=your_token_here
./reviewer-karma
```

### Building Docker Image

```bash
docker build -t reviewer-karma .
docker run -e GITHUB_TOKEN=your_token_here reviewer-karma
```

## Architecture

The action is built with:

- **Go 1.24+**: For efficient, cross-platform execution
- **GitHub REST API**: For fetching PR and review data
- **Docker**: For containerized execution in GitHub Actions
- **OAuth2**: For secure GitHub API authentication

## Performance

- Efficiently handles repositories with 100+ PRs
- Uses pagination to fetch all data
- Processes reviews and comments in batches
- Minimal API rate limit impact

## Update Modes

### Full Recreation (Default)
- Processes **all PRs** every time the action runs
- **Always accurate** - no risk of stale data
- **Handles deletions** - works correctly if PRs are deleted/modified
- **Best for**: Small to medium repositories (<500 PRs)

### Incremental Updates
- Processes **only new PRs** that haven't been seen before
- **Much faster** - skips already processed PRs
- **Uses storage** - maintains `.karma-data.json` file
- **Best for**: Large repositories (500+ PRs)

To enable incremental updates:
```yaml
- name: Run Reviewer Karma Action
  uses: ./
  with:
    incremental-update: 'true'
```

**Note**: When using incremental updates, the action will create a `.karma-data.json` file to track processed PRs. Make sure to commit this file along with `REVIEWERS.md`.

## Custom Scoring Strategies

### üéØ **Quality-Focused Scoring**
Emphasize detailed feedback over quick approvals:
```yaml
review-point: '1'                    # Low base points
positive-emoji-point: '1'            # Low emoji value
constructive-comment-point: '5'      # High value for detailed feedback
```

### üöÄ **Engagement-Focused Scoring**
Encourage active participation and positive interactions:
```yaml
review-point: '3'                    # Good base points
positive-emoji-point: '3'            # High emoji value
constructive-comment-point: '2'      # Balanced feedback value
```

### ‚öñÔ∏è **Balanced Scoring**
Equal emphasis on all types of contributions:
```yaml
review-point: '2'                    # Balanced base points
positive-emoji-point: '2'            # Balanced emoji value
constructive-comment-point: '2'      # Balanced feedback value
```

### üèÜ **Competitive Scoring**
High points for all activities to create more competitive leaderboards:
```yaml
review-point: '5'                    # High base points
positive-emoji-point: '3'            # Medium emoji value
constructive-comment-point: '5'      # High feedback value
```

The leaderboard will automatically display your custom scoring values instead of the defaults!
